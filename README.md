# People Contact Reminder List

A small Windows .NET 4.5 WPF app to help you remember to do things! It was made as a way to remember to email/communicate with people on a regular basis without having to constantly load up email to remember when a person was contacted last. The app lets you toggle when a person has been communicated with ("waiting on me" vs "waiting on them") and sets the date for when the toggle is switched. If it's been "off" ("waiting on them") for too long (length of time is configurable), it's time for me to contact them because they've forgotten to contact me, so the app automatically switches the toggle on with a red color to remind me to contact that person again!

The app supports a virtually unlimited number of lists, each of which can have different time length/configurations. Each list can have a virtually unlimited number of items.

The app also supports saving and loading to discrete files.
